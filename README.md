# Implementation of machine learning models

In this project, with Python, classification results for k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes classifier (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and a combination method (Ensemble) have been obtained by at least 3 different algorithms through k-fold cross validation for k=3. 
Dimension reduction has also been applied by PCA and LDA methods and again the results have been obtained.
